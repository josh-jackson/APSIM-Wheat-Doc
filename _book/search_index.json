Before the terminal spikelet stage, the soil temperature is estimated using soil model in APSIM and used to calcualte the thermal time. After terminal spikelet stage, the air temperature is directly used. 2.2 Stages and periods The growth cycle of wheat is started from sowing and finished at harvest ripe.The whole cycle is separated into 10 stages and 10 phases. Wheat jumps into next stage or phase when certian conditions are statisfied (earliness “per se”, vernalization and photoperiod). Stage Name Description 1 Sowing Sow seeds into field 2 Germination Germination begins when the seed imbibes water from the soil and reaches 35 to 45 percent moisture on a dry weight basis 3 Emergence The coleoptile extends to the soil surface 4 TerminalSpikelet The terminal spikelet initial is formed 5 FlagLeaf The appearance of flag leaf tip or ligule (??) 6 Flowering The 50% plants are flowering in the field 7 StartGrainFill Grain filling follows anthesis and refers to the period during which the kernel matures or ripens 8 EndGrainFill Grain filling follows anthesis and refers to the period during which the kernel matures or ripens 9 Maturity Grain dry weight reaches its maximum which is correlated to the absence of green color in the chaff or kernels 10 HarvestRipe Wheat is ready for harvest Each phase has a targer thermal time (earliness per se) and several impact factors to extend the growing period including vernalization, photoperiod, water, nitrogen stresses.

The phyllochron is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of leaves on the main stem of a plant. Based on (Jamieson et al. 1998), leaf appearace could be described by a base phyllochron determined between leaves 2 and 7 and a phyllochron that was 70% of base phyllochron for leaves &lt; 2 and 130% of base phyllochron for leaves &gt; 7. The base phyllochron set as 100 oCd. References "],
["structure.html", "Chapter 3 Structure 3.1 Promordia and node number 3.2 Tillering 3.3 Population", " Chapter 3 Structure The Structure model predicts the development and mortality of phytomer and branch (tiller) according to plastochron and phyllochron. 3.1 Promordia and node number Three primordias are initizliaed at stage Emergence (Section 2.2). The primordia number in main stem (MainStemPrimordiaNo, Section 4.2) is daily increased according to plastochron (Section 2.3) until stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 2.2). The leaf (node in next generation APSIM) number in the main stem is daily increased according to the phyllochron (Section 2.3) until maximum leaf number is reached. The total leaf number in the main stem (MainStemFinalNodeNumber, Section 4.2) is initialized as 30 and reset as the primordia number at stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 2.2). The node number in the main stem (MainStemNodeNo, Section 4.2) is daily increasing since stage Emergence (Section 2.2) until reach the final node number according to the phyllochron and daily thermal time. Figure 3.1: Final node number in main stem Daily changes of primordia (\\(\\Delta N_{pri}\\)) and node (leaf) (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) number in main stem are calculated using plastochron (\\(P_{pla}\\)) and phyllochron (\\(P_{phy}\\)), respectively, after plant stage Emergence (Section 2.2 and Figure 3.2). \\[ \\Delta N_{pri}=rac{\\Delta TT_{d}}{P_{pla}} \\] \\[ \\Delta N_{node}=rac{\\Delta TT_{t}}{P_{phy}} \\] where, \\(\\Delta TT_{t}\\) is the daily thermal time, which calculates from parameter ThermalTime. \\(P_{pla}\\) and \\(P_{phy}\\) calculates from parameter MainStemPrimordiaInitiationRate (plastochron) and MainStemNodeAppearanceRate (phyllochron), respectively (Section 2.3). The daily delta primodia number is not a output variable. Figure 3.2: Daily increase of node number in main stem Total number of primordia (\\(N_{pri}\\)) and node (\\(N_{node}\\)) in main stem are summarised since initialisation. \\[ N_{pri}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{p} \\] \\[ N_{node}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{n} \\] where, \\(T_{0}\\) is day of plant initialisation which is set by Leaf model (Emergence for wheat). \\(T\\) is today. In the Structure model, the primordia and node numbers are not calculated for branches or tillers, but only for main stem (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3: Primordia and node number in main stem 3.2 Tillering The tiller number is too sensitive to WSC stress (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). This feature is disabled in all analysis In next generation APSIM, tillering for wheat is referred as branching. New tillers are initialised when increase of the node number in main stem (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) is more than 1 although the branching rate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)) is calculate everyday (Figure 3.5). The new branch number for each plant is specified by parameter BranchingRate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)), which could be a function of branch number on leaf rank in main stem. \\[ P_{branch} = P \\times \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{branch} \\] The branching rate is defined by potential branching rate and stresses (nitrogen and WSC). From stage Emergence to Terminal Spikelet (Section 2.2), the potential branching rate is defined as a function of number of appreared cohorts in the main stem (Figure 3.4). Beyond this period, the branching rate is set as zero. Figure 3.4: Branching rate of APSIM-Wheat as a function of appreared cohort number Figure 3.5 shows the branching rate and total branching number in the test simulation Figure 3.5: The branching rate and branch number for wheat It seems PMF uses the branching rate one day before to calculate the branch number. Figure 3.6: The mortality of tillers 3.3 Population Plant population (\\(P\\)) is initialised at sowing from Sow event, and daily reduced by the plant mortality (\\(\\Delta P\\)). \\[ P=P_{0} - \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}(\\Delta P) \\] where, \\(P_{0}\\) is the sown population, which initialised at sowing. Population of main stem number (\\(P_{ms}\\)) is calculated according to plant population (\\(P\\)) and primary bud number (\\(N_{bud}\\)) with default value 1. The unit of \\(P_{ms}\\) is per square meter. \\[ P_{ms}=P \\times N_{bud} \\] Population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) is summed up population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) and branches ((\\(P_{branch}\\))). \\[ P_{stem} = P_{ms} + P_{branch} \\] Three factors are considered to reduce the population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)), i.e. 1) Plant mortality (\\(\\Delta P\\)), 2) Drought(\\(\\Delta N_{drought}\\)), 3) Shade (\\(\\Delta N_{shade}\\)). During a day, branches are first killed by plant mortality which reduces population through killing all stems in a plant. \\[ P_{branch} = P_{branch} - rac{(P_{branch} + P_{ms})}{P_{ms}} \\times \\Delta P \\] Then environmental stresses (drought and shade) only cause mortality of the remaining branches. \\[ P_{branch} = P_{branch} \\times [1 - (\\Delta N_{drought}+\\Delta N_{shade})] \\] The mortalities, caused by drought (\\(\\Delta N_{drought}\\)) and shade (\\(\\Delta N_{shade}\\)), are calculated by parameters DroughtInducedBranchMortality and ShadeInducedBranchMortality, respectively.
