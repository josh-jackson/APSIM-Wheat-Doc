Phyllochron The phyllochron is the thermal time it takes for successive leaves on a shoot to reach the same developmental stage. 2.2 Structure Node (Phytomer) A phytomer unit is defined as consisting of a leaf, and the associated axillary bud, node and internode. Main stem The first culm that emerges from the seeds is the main stem. Branch (Tiller) All remaining culms that emerges from main stem or other branches (tillers), are referred as branches or tillers. 2.3 Leaf Leaf organ is only included leaf blades excluding section under sheath, i.e. only parts of leaf blades to produce photosynthate. Huan Index is mainly concerned with the leaf production stage of development (Haun 1973). The length of each emerging leaf is expressed as a fraction of the length of the preceding fully emerged leaf. For example, a 3.2 indicates that three leaves are fully emerged, and a fourth leaf has emerged two-tenths of the length of the third. "],

Leaf includes only leaf blades. Stem is defined in a functional rather than amorphological manner and includes plant stems, leaf sheaths. Head is divided into Grain and Pod (which correspond to spike without the grain). A photo is required to see the defination of organs. "],

Before the terminal spikelet stage, the soil temperature is estimated using soil model in APSIM and used to calcualte the thermal time. After terminal spikelet stage, the air temperature is directly used. 4.2 Stages and periods The growth cycle of wheat is started from sowing and finished at harvest ripe.The whole cycle is separated into 10 stages and 10 phases. Wheat jumps into next stage or phase when certian conditions are statisfied (earliness “per se”, vernalization and photoperiod).

["cha-structure.html", "Chapter 5 Structure 5.1 Plastochron and phyllochron 5.2 Promordia and node number 5.3 Tillering 5.4 Population 5.5 Mortality 5.6 Canopy height", " Chapter 5 Structure The Structure model predicts the development and mortality of phytomer and branch (tiller) according to plastochron and phyllochron. 5.1 Plastochron and phyllochron A plastochron is defined as the time interval between two successive recurring events during the growth of plant shoots, such as leaf initiation. The phyllochron is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of leaves on the main stem of a plant (McMaster and Hunt 2003). The non-linear reponse of temperature on phyllchron were observed by Friend et al. (1962) and Cao and Moss (1989). The soil temperature provided more accurately prediction of leaf development than air temperature (P. D. Jamieson et al. 1995). However, a simple linear reponse of phyllochron to air temperature works surprusingly well in predicting phyllochron for most field conditions (McMaster and Hunt 2003). If improvements are desired, the use of non-linear reponses and soil temperature shows promise (P. D. Jamieson et al. 1995; Yan and Hunt 1999). Consequently, we assume the linear reponse of air temperature on leaf appearance (phyllochorn) in the current APSIM-Wheat model. Brown et al. (2013) showed final leaf number (FLN) could be estimated as 2.86 + HSTS * 1.1 where HSTS is the the Haun stage at terminal spikelet. To caputre this in the wheat model we have set the initial number of primordia (determined by the number of initialleaf objects on the leaf class) to 3 and have set this function to produce primordia 10% faster than mainstem leaves. Primordia are initiated until the therminal spikelet stage and then the number remains fixed, giving final leaf number. Based on (P. D. Jamieson et al. 1995), leaf appearance could be described by a base phyllochron determined between leaves 2 and 7 and a phyllochron that was 70% of base phyllochron for leaves &lt; 2 and 130% of base phyllochroen for leaves &gt; 7. The base phyllochron set as 100 oCd. In the wheat model, we use a fake plastochron when are calculated from emergence to terminal spikelet. Figure 5.1: Phyllochron of leaf cohort is depending on the rank on the main stem 5.2 Promordia and node number Three primordias are initialized at stage Emergence (Section 4.2). The primordia number in main stem (MainStemPrimordiaNo, Section 2.2) is daily increased according to plastochron (Section 5.1) until stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 4.2). The leaf (node in next generation APSIM) number in the main stem is daily increased according to the phyllochron (Section 5.1) until maximum leaf number is reached. The total leaf number in the main stem (MainStemFinalNodeNumber, Section 2.2) is initialized as 30 and reset as the primordia number at stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 4.2). The node number in the main stem (MainStemNodeNo, Section 2.2) is daily increasing since stage Emergence (Section 4.2) until reach the final node number according to the phyllochron and daily thermal time. Figure 5.2: Final node number in main stem Daily changes of primordia (\\(\\Delta N_{pri}\\)) and node (leaf) (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) number in main stem are calculated using plastochron (\\(P_{pla}\\)) and phyllochron (\\(P_{phy}\\)), respectively, after plant stage Emergence (Section 4.2 and Figure ??). \\[ \\Delta N_{pri}=rac{\\Delta TT_{d}}{P_{pla}} \\] \\[ \\Delta N_{node}=rac{\\Delta TT_{t}}{P_{phy}} \\] where, \\(\\Delta TT_{t}\\) is the daily thermal time, which calculates from parameter ThermalTime. \\(P_{pla}\\) and \\(P_{phy}\\) calculates from parameter MainStemPrimordiaInitiationRate (plastochron) and MainStemNodeAppearanceRate (phyllochron), respectively (Section 5.1). The daily delta primordia number is not a output variable. Total number of primordia (\\(N_{pri}\\)) and node (\\(N_{node}\\)) in main stem are summarized since initialization. \\[ N_{pri}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{p} \\] \\[ N_{node}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{n} \\] where, \\(T_{0}\\) is day of plant initialization which is set by Leaf model (Emergence for wheat). \\(T\\) is today. In the Structure model, the primordia and node numbers are not calculated for branches or tillers, but only for main stem (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3: Primordia and node number in main stem The primordia and node numbers in the main stem are not necessary integar to simulate the variation of primordia number in the actual field. Consequently all attibutes of flag leaf are proportionally reduced (e.g. growth duration and maximum area). The relative appeared node number (RelativeNodeAppearance) is calculated as the fraction of appeared node number on the final node number. As the final node number is initialized as 30 as reset to primordia number at the stage Terminal Spikelet, the output variable RelativeNodeAppearance is suddenly increased at stage Terminal Spikelet (Figure 5.4). Figure 5.4: The fraction of appeared node nubmer on the final node number 5.3 Tillering The tiller number is too sensitive to WSC stress (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). This feature is disabled in all analysis In next generation APSIM, tillering for wheat is referred as branching. New tillers are initialized when increase of the node number in main stem (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) is more than 1 although the branching rate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)) is calculate everyday (Figure 5.7). The new branch number for each plant is specified by parameter BranchingRate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)), which could be a function of branch number on leaf rank in main stem. \\[ P_{branch} = P \\times \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{branch} \\] The branching rate is defined by potential branching rate and stresses (nitrogen and WSC). From stage Emergence to Terminal Spikelet (Section 4.2), the potential branching rate is defined as a function of number of appeared cohorts in the main stem (Figure 5.5). Beyond this period, the branching rate is set as zero. Figure 5.5: Branching rate of APSIM-Wheat as a function of appreared cohort number Two stresses are defined in the APSIM-Wheat including nitrogen and WSC. A simple sensitivity analysis indicates the branching rate is too sensitive to WSC with default values (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). So, this feature is disabled for further analysis. The nitrogen stress is calculated as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand which is exported from the Arbitrator module (Chapter 11). Wheat module assumes no nitrogen stress when the nitrogen supply is bigger than 1.5 times of nitrogen demand (Figure 5.6). Nitrogen stress linearly increases when supply/demand ratio less then 1.5 (Reference required.) Figure 5.6: Nitrogen stress on branching rate as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand Figure 5.7 shows the branching rate and total branching number in the test simulation without nitrogen stress on branching rate during branching period (from Emergence to Terminal Spikelet, Figure 10.2). Figure 5.7: The branching rate and branch number for wheat It seems PMF uses the branching rate one day before to calculate the branch number. 5.4 Population Plant population (\\(P\\)) is initialized at sowing from Sow event, and daily reduced by the plant mortality (\\(\\Delta P\\)). \\[ P=P_{0} - \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}(\\Delta P) \\] where, \\(P_{0}\\) is the sown population, which initialized at sowing. Population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) is calculated according to plant population (\\(P\\)) and primary bud number (\\(N_{bud}\\)) with default value 1. The unit of \\(P_{ms}\\) is per square meter. \\[ P_{ms}=P \\times N_{bud} \\] Population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) is summed up population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) and branches ((\\(P_{branch}\\))). \\[ P_{stem} = P_{ms} + P_{branch} \\] In the test simulation, the plant density (\\(P\\)) is 150 plants m2, so population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) equals to plant density (Figure 5.8). From Emergence to terminal spikelet, the population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) multiply by stem number and plant density (Figure 5.7). Figure 5.8: The total population of main stem and all stems 5.5 Mortality Branching mortality starts from the Terminal Spikelet until Flowering which defines as a function of moving mean tiller growth rate (Figure 5.9. The mean tiller growth rate is calculated as the 5 days moving means of tiller growth rate, which is calculated by the daily biomass supply divides thermal time and total stem population. Reference required.

["cha-leaf.html", "Chapter 6 Leaf 6.1 Life growth cycle 6.2 Cohort population 6.3 Development of leaf size 6.4 Ground coverage 6.5 Leaf biomass 6.6 Frost impact", " Chapter 6 Leaf Leaf cohort model is used in the APSIM-Wheat. 6.1 Life growth cycle The growth cycle of leaf cohort is divided into 7 stages and 6 periods from Initialized to Detached. The length of each period depends on the plastrochron and phylochron for initialization and appearance and is configured by CohortParameters for others. Several status variables are defined for each leaf cohort, which can be used in other modules to describe the current status of leaf cohort, i.e. IsNotAppeared, IsGrowing, IsAlive, IsGreen, IsNotSenescing, Senescing, isFullyExpanded, ShouldBeDead, IsAppeared and IsInitialised. Figure 6.1: The life cycle of a leaf cohort. 6.1.1 leaf age The age of leaf cohort is defined as the thermal time after appearance, (i.e. keep zero after initialization). As the default values of DetachmentLagDuration and DetachmentDuration are set as 1000000 °Cd, the cohort age keeps increasing until growth stage ReadyForHarvesting. Figure 6.2: Age of leaf cohort as a function of stage or accumulated thermal time The age of first leaf cohort starts from 200 °Cd. 6.1.2 Leaf initialization A new leaf is initialized when the primordia number is increased by 1 at the main stem. Consequently, the total leaf cohort number is equal to total primordia number. The initialized rate of leaf cohort is equal to plastochron. Figure 6.3: The primordia number in the main stem and initialised cohort number The plastochron supposed to 1.1 times of phyllochron. However the slope of Figure (???)(fig:leaf-init-number)B (plastochron) is constant which is contrast with the slope of (???)(fig:leaf-appear-number)B (phyllochron). 6.1.3 Leaf appearance A new leaf is appeared when the node number is increased by 1 at the main stem. Consequently, the appearance rate of leaf cohort is equal to phyllochron. Most of parameters of leaf cohort are determined at leaf appearance. Figure 6.4: The node number in the main stem and appeared cohort number 6.1.4 Growth duration In APSIM-Wheat model, leaf expansion of cohort \\(i\\) starts from appearance of leaf tip \\(i\\), i.e. the expasion of leaf cohort in the sheath is ignored which does not contribute to green leaf or leaf area index. The growth duration of spring wheat is close to one phylochron as the synchronization of leaf blade and sheath (Skinner and Nelson 1995). As the variation of phyllochron (Fig. 5.1), the growth duration also changes by cohort rank. The growth duration of flag leaf is shorter than secondary leaf as the fraction of flag leaf (Fig. ??. Figure 6.5: Growth duration of leaf cohort which is determined at appearance of leaf cohort. 6.1.5 Lag duration Lag duration (full functional duration) is defined as 4 phyllochrons for leaf appeared during vegetative period (from emergence to terminal spikelet). For leaf cohort appeared during stem elongation period (from terminal spikelet to flag leaf), the lag duration equals to total length from stage FlagLeaf to stage EndGrainFill minus 3 phyllochron (senescence duration), i.e. flag leaf is completely death at the stage EndGrainFill. Figure 6.6: Lag duration of leaf cohort which is determined at appearance of leaf cohort. 6.1.6 Senescene and detachment duration Senescence duration is defined as 3 phyllochrons. Detachment lag and detachment duration are set as a big value 1000000 which assumes no detachment in wheat. Actually all leaves are detached at Harvesting event. Figure 6.7 shows the number of leaf cohort for expanding, initialized, appeared, senescing and dead cohort. Figure 6.7: Initialized, appeared and expanding cohort number The expanding leaves are jumping up and down which is caused by the strange duration of leaf growth. We should expect the same growth duration for Leaf 1 and Leaf 2, Leaf 3, 4 and 6. 6.1.7 Drought stress After appearance, leaf development is accelerated by the drought stress through increasing the daily thermal time, i.e. leaf age is accelerated by drought. The factor of acceleration depends on the ratio of water supply and demand (Figure 9.1). Daily thermal time is doubled when there is no water supply (i.e. Ratio of water supply and demand equals to zero), and no acceleration when ratio above 0.7 (The values in Figure 6.8 plus one). Figure 6.8: Drought stress accelerates leaf development. Daily thermal time is doubled when there is no water supply (i.e. Ratio of water supply and demand equals to zero), and no acceleration when ratio above 0.7. //Acellerate thermal time accumulation if crop is water stressed. double _ThermalTime; if ((LeafCohortParameters.DroughtInducedSenAcceleration != null) &amp;&amp; (IsFullyExpanded)) _ThermalTime = TT * LeafCohortParameters.DroughtInducedSenAcceleration.Value; else _ThermalTime = TT; 6.2 Cohort population Cohort population is initialized as the total stem population at appearance of leaf cohort, and proportionally reduced by plant and stem mortalities (@ref(#sec-structure-mortality)) at each day after appearance. The total leaf number is multiplied by leaf cohort number and stem number (Figure 6.9). Figure 6.9: Appeared number of green, senesced and total leaves The tiller death is detached from plants, but leaf death isn’t detached. The fraction of final leaf is set as 1, but return the actual fraction of the final leaf if the last leaf has appeared. 6.3 Development of leaf size During the growth duration of each cohort, the daily increase of leaf area is detemined by the minimum increase of water (\\(\\Delta A_{water}\\)) and carbon (\\(\\Delta A_{carbon}\\)) constrained leaf area. 6.3.1 Maximum (potential) leaf area The maximum leaf area of each leaf cohort is determined by potential maximum leaf area and reduced by cell division stress and final leaf fraction when leaf cohort is appeared. The potential maximum leaf areas by rank are specified by two parameters the maximum leaf area in all leaves (AreaLargestLeaves with default value 2600 mm2) and an age factor (Figure ??). The age factor is assumed leaf areas are linearly increasing from stage Emergence to Terminal spikelet, and all leaves appeared after stage Terminal Spikelet have the same maximum leaf area (the last three leaves in the current configuration of plastochron and phyllochron, Figure 5.3). The function of maximum leaf size is proposed to change. Documentation needs to update. The stress factor of cell division is determined by water (Figure 9.1) and nitrogen stresses (Figure 10.1). Stress of cell division is averaged by cell division stress factors from initialization to appearance. In the test simulation, the maximum leaf areas are increasing from Rank 1 to Rank 9, then decreasing to flag leaf (Figure 6.10), which is caused by nitrogen stress after terminal spikelet (Figure 10.1). Figure 6.10: Maximum area of leaf cohort as a function of stage or accumulated thermal time 6.3.2 Potential expansion of leaf cohort The potential leaf area is calculated by a logistic equation as a function of thermal time after leaf appearance. The shape of logistic equation is determiend by parameter LeafSizeShapeParameter with default value 0.3 (Fig. 6.11). Figure 6.11: The size function of leaf area development 6.3.3 Water constrained leaf area The potential increase of leaf area is reduced by ExpansionStress with default value 1 6.3.4 Carbon constrained leaf area Figure 6.12: Delta of leaf area constrained by water and carbon.

The extinction coefficient for green leaf (\\(k_{g}\\)) is calculated by parameter ExtinctionCoeff which is depending on LAI and water stress. In the current version of APSIM-Wheat, extinction coefficient is set as 0.5 without variation as leaf area index. Extinction coefficient of dead leaf (kd) is not setable in the APSIM User Interface which is defined in the xml file. Figure 6.16: Extinction coefficient as a function of leaf area index (LAI) The extinction coefficient of green leaf is adjusted by water stress which is the ratio of water supply and demand. No adjustment is applied to extinction coefficient if water supply is more than water demand. However, extinction coefficient is reduced when water supply is less than water demand (Figure 6.17, i.e. \\(k\\) = 0.25 when no water supply).

This water-limited biomass (\\(\\Delta Q_{w}\\)) is a function of the ratio between the daily water uptake (\\(W_{u}\\)) and demand (\\(W_{d}\\)) capped by \\[\\Delta Q_{w}=\\Delta Q_{r}f_{w,\\,photo}=\\Delta Q_{r}\\frac{W_{u}}{W_{d}}\\label{eq:WaterStressBiomassProduction-1}\\] where \\(f_{w,\\,photo}\\) is the water stress factor affecting photosynthesis (); \\(W_{u}\\) is the actual daily water uptake from the root system (which corresponds to the soil water supply (\\(W_{s}\\)) capped by \\(W_{d}\\)), \\(W_{d}\\) is the soil water demand of Leaf and Head parts (). When the soil water is non-limiting (\\(f_{w,\\,photo}\\) = 1, i.e. \\(W_{d}\\geq W_{s}\\)), biomass accumulation is limited by the radiation (\\(\\Delta Q=\\Delta Q_{r}\\)). When the soil water is limiting, biomass accumulation is limited by water supply (\\(\\Delta Q=\\Delta Q_{w}\\)). The water demand (\\(W_{d}\\), in mm) corresponds to the amount of water the crop would have transpired in the absence of soil water constraint, and is calculated from the potential biomass accumulation from RUE (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\)). Following (???), transpiration demand is modeled as a function of the current day’s crop growth rate, estimated by the potential biomass accumulation associated with intercepted radiation (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\), see ), divided by the transpiration efficiency. \\[W_{d}=\\frac{\\Delta Q_{r}-R}{TE}\\label{eq:soilWaterDemand-1}\\] where \\(R\\) is respiration rate and equals to zero in the current version of APSIM-Wheat, \\(TE\\) is transpiration efficiency (). See for more details about water demand and supply. The daily biomass accumulation (\\(\\Delta Q\\)) corresponds to dry matter above ground biomass is limited by the radiation interception (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\)) or by soil water deficiency (\\(\\Delta Q_{w}\\)), so that daily biomass accumulation can be expressed as: \\[\\Delta Q=\\begin{cases} \\Delta Q_{r}\\qquad &amp; W_{u}=W_{d}\\\\ \\Delta Q_{w}\\qquad &amp; W_{u}&lt;W_{d} \\end{cases}\\label{eq:actualBiomassProduction}\\] where \\(W_{s}\\) is water supply, \\(W_{d}\\) is the soil water demand from the shoot, limited by radiation interception (). In the current APSIM-Wheat, \\(W_{d}\\) is actually only directly affected by the soil water demand of the leaf (). \\(W_{u}\\) and \\(W_{d}\\) are calculated by soil module of APSIM. 7.2 Biomass partitioning Photosynthate is not partitioned into root after heading (Fang et al. 2016).
