Phyllochron The phyllochron is the thermal time it takes for successive leaves on a shoot to reach the same developmental stage. 2.2 Structure Node (Phytomer) A phytomer unit is defined as consisting of a leaf, and the associated axillary bud, node and internode. Main stem The first culm that emerges from the seeds is the main stem. Branch (Tiller) All remaining culms that emerges from main stem or other branches (tillers), are referred as branches or tillers. 2.3 Leaf "],

Before the terminal spikelet stage, the soil temperature is estimated using soil model in APSIM and used to calcualte the thermal time. After terminal spikelet stage, the air temperature is directly used. 3.2 Stages and periods The growth cycle of wheat is started from sowing and finished at harvest ripe.The whole cycle is separated into 10 stages and 10 phases. Wheat jumps into next stage or phase when certian conditions are statisfied (earliness “per se”, vernalization and photoperiod). Stage Name Description 1 Sowing Sow seeds into field 2 Germination Germination begins when the seed imbibes water from the soil and reaches 35 to 45 percent moisture on a dry weight basis 3 Emergence The coleoptile extends to the soil surface 4 TerminalSpikelet The terminal spikelet initial is formed 5 FlagLeaf The appearance of flag leaf tip or ligule (??) 6 Flowering The 50% plants are flowering in the field 7 StartGrainFill Grain filling follows anthesis and refers to the period during which the kernel matures or ripens 8 EndGrainFill Grain filling follows anthesis and refers to the period during which the kernel matures or ripens 9 Maturity Grain dry weight reaches its maximum which is correlated to the absence of green color in the chaff or kernels 10 HarvestRipe Wheat is ready for harvest Each phase has a targer thermal time (earliness per se) and several impact factors to extend the growing period including vernalization, photoperiod, water, nitrogen stresses.

The phyllochron is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of leaves on the main stem of a plant. Based on (Jamieson et al. 1998), leaf appearace could be described by a base phyllochron determined between leaves 2 and 7 and a phyllochron that was 70% of base phyllochron for leaves &lt; 2 and 130% of base phyllochron for leaves &gt; 7. The base phyllochron set as 100 oCd.

The primordia number in main stem (MainStemPrimordiaNo, Section 2.2) is daily increased according to plastochron (Section 3.3) until stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2). The leaf (node in next generation APSIM) number in the main stem is daily increased according to the phyllochron (Section 3.3) until maximum leaf number is reached. The total leaf number in the main stem (MainStemFinalNodeNumber, Section 2.2) is initialized as 30 and reset as the primordia number at stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2). The node number in the main stem (MainStemNodeNo, Section 2.2) is daily increasing since stage Emergence (Section 3.2) until reach the final node number according to the phyllochron and daily thermal time. Figure 4.1: Final node number in main stem Daily changes of primordia (\\(\\Delta N_{pri}\\)) and node (leaf) (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) number in main stem are calculated using plastochron (\\(P_{pla}\\)) and phyllochron (\\(P_{phy}\\)), respectively, after plant stage Emergence (Section 3.2 and Figure 4.2). \\[ \\Delta N_{pri}=rac{\\Delta TT_{d}}{P_{pla}} \\] \\[ \\Delta N_{node}=rac{\\Delta TT_{t}}{P_{phy}} \\] where, \\(\\Delta TT_{t}\\) is the daily thermal time, which calculates from parameter ThermalTime. \\(P_{pla}\\) and \\(P_{phy}\\) calculates from parameter MainStemPrimordiaInitiationRate (plastochron) and MainStemNodeAppearanceRate (phyllochron), respectively (Section 3.3). The daily delta primodia number is not a output variable. Figure 4.2: Daily increase of node number in main stem Total number of primordia (\\(N_{pri}\\)) and node (\\(N_{node}\\)) in main stem are summarised since initialisation. \\[ N_{pri}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{p} \\] \\[ N_{node}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{n} \\] where, \\(T_{0}\\) is day of plant initialisation which is set by Leaf model (Emergence for wheat). \\(T\\) is today. In the Structure model, the primordia and node numbers are not calculated for branches or tillers, but only for main stem (Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Primordia and node number in main stem 4.2 Tillering The tiller number is too sensitive to WSC stress (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). This feature is disabled in all analysis In next generation APSIM, tillering for wheat is referred as branching. New tillers are initialised when increase of the node number in main stem (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) is more than 1 although the branching rate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)) is calculate everyday (Figure 4.6). The new branch number for each plant is specified by parameter BranchingRate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)), which could be a function of branch number on leaf rank in main stem. \\[ P_{branch} = P \\times \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{branch} \\] The branching rate is defined by potential branching rate and stresses (nitrogen and WSC). From stage Emergence to Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2), the potential branching rate is defined as a function of number of appreared cohorts in the main stem (Figure 4.4). Beyond this period, the branching rate is set as zero. Figure 4.4: Branching rate of APSIM-Wheat as a function of appreared cohort number Two stresses are defined in the APSIM-Wheat inclduing nitrogen and WSC. A simple sensitivity analysis indicates the branching rate is too sensitive to WSC with default values (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). So, this feature is disabled for further analysis. The nitrogen stress is calculated as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand which is exported from the Arbitrator module (Chaptor 6). Wheat module assumes no nitrogen stress when the nitrogen supply is bigger than 1.5 times of nitrogen demand (Figure 4.5). Nitreogen stress linearly recreases when supply/demand ratio less then 1.5 (Reference required.) Figure 4.5: Nitrogen stress on branching rate as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand Figure 4.6 shows the branching rate and total branching number in the test simulation without nitrogen stress on branching rate during branching period (from Emergence to Terminal Spikelet, Figure 4.7). Figure 4.6: The branching rate and branch number for wheat It seems PMF uses the branching rate one day before to calculate the branch number. Figure 4.7: The fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand 4.3 Population Plant population (\\(P\\)) is initialised at sowing from Sow event, and daily reduced by the plant mortality (\\(\\Delta P\\)). \\[ P=P_{0} - \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}(\\Delta P) \\] where, \\(P_{0}\\) is the sown population, which initialised at sowing. Population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) is calculated according to plant population (\\(P\\)) and primary bud number (\\(N_{bud}\\)) with default value 1. The unit of \\(P_{ms}\\) is per square meter. \\[ P_{ms}=P \\times N_{bud} \\] Population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) is summed up population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) and branches ((\\(P_{branch}\\))). \\[ P_{stem} = P_{ms} + P_{branch} \\] In the test simulation, the plant density (\\(P\\)) is 150 plants m2, so population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) equals to plant density (Figure 4.8). From Emergence to terminal spikelet, the population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) multiply by stem number and plant density (Figure 4.6). Figure 4.8: The total population of main stem and all stems 4.4 Mortality Branching mortality starts from the Terminal Spikelet until Flowering which defines as a function of moving mean tiller growth rate (Figure 4.9. The mean tiller growth rate is calculated as the 5 days moving means of tiller growth rate, which is calculated by the daily biomass supply divides thermal time and total stem population. Reference required. Figure 4.9: Tiller mortality as a function of moving mean tiller growth rate Figure 4.11 and 4.10 show the mean tiller growth rate and the three factors to calculate it in the test simulation. Figure 4.10: The moving tiller growth rate Figure 4.11: Three factors to calculate the tiller growth rate Figure 4.12: The mortality of tillers As the primary bud number is equal to 1, the plant total node number and total primary node number are the same (Figure 4.13). Figure 4.13 show the total node number as the results of tiller appearing and mortality. Figure 4.13: Total plant node number "],
["cha-leaf.html", "Chapter 5 Leaf 5.1 Life growth cycle 5.2 Photosynthesis 5.3 Leaf area index and coverage", " Chapter 5 Leaf Leaf cohort model is used in the APSIM-Wheat. 5.1 Life growth cycle The growth cycle of leaf cohort is divided into 7 stages and 6 periods from Initialized to Detached. The length of each period depends on the plastrochron and phylochron for initialization and appearance and is configured by CohortParameters for others. Several status variables are defined for each leaf cohort, which can be used in other modules to describe the current status of leaf cohort, i.e. IsNotAppeared, IsGrowing, IsAlive, IsGreen, IsNotSenescing, Senescing, isFullyExpanded, ShouldBeDead, IsAppeared and IsInitialised. 5.1.1 leaf age The age of leaf cohort is defined as the thermal time after appearance, (i.e. keep zero after initialization). As the default values of DetachmentLagDuration and DetachmentDuration are set as 1000000 °Cd, the cohort age keeps increasing until stage ReadyForHarvesting. Figure 5.1: Age of leaf cohort as a function of stage or accumulated thermal time 5.1.2 Leaf initialization A new leaf is initialized when the primordia number is increased by 1 at the main stem. Consequently, the total leaf cohort number is equal to total primordia number. The initialized rate of leaf cohort is equal to plastrochron. Figure 5.2: The primordia number in the main stem and initialised cohort number Actually, the total leaf primordia number is slightly less than the total cohort number. The plastrochron supposed to 1.1 times of phyllochron. However the slope of Figure (???)(fig:leaf-init-number)B (plastrochorn) is constant which is contrast with the slope of (???)(fig:leaf-appear-number)B (phyllochron). 5.1.3 Leaf appearance A new leaf is appeared when the node number is increased by 1 at the main stem. Consequently, the appearance rate of leaf cohort is equal to phyllochron. Figure 5.3: The node number in the main stem and appeared cohort number 5.1.4 Other periods The lengths of other periods are determined when a new leaf initialized. Growth duration is defined as a phyllochron. Lag duration is defined as 4 phyllochrons for leaf appeared during vegetative period (from emergence to terminal spikelet). For leaf cohort apeared during stem alongtation period (from terminal spikelet to flag leaf), the lag duration equals to total length from stage FlagLeaf to stage EndGrainFill minus 3 phyllochron (senescence duration). Senescence duration is defined as 3 phyllochrons. Detachment lag and dutachment duration are set as a big value 1000000 which assumes no detachment in wheat. Actually all leaves are detached at Harvesting event. Figure 5.4 shows the number of leaf cohort for expanding, initilised, appeared, senescing and dead cohort. Figure 5.4: Initialized, appeared and expanding cohort number The totlal leaf number is multiplied by leaf cohort number and stem number (Figure 5.5).
