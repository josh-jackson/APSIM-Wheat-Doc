Before the terminal spikelet stage, the soil temperature is estimated using soil model in APSIM and used to calcualte the thermal time. After terminal spikelet stage, the air temperature is directly used. 3.2 Stages and periods The growth cycle of wheat is started from sowing and finished at harvest ripe.The whole cycle is separated into 10 stages and 10 phases. Wheat jumps into next stage or phase when certian conditions are statisfied (earliness “per se”, vernalization and photoperiod). Stage Name Description 1 Sowing Sow seeds into field 2 Germination Germination begins when the seed imbibes water from the soil and reaches 35 to 45 percent moisture on a dry weight basis 3 Emergence The coleoptile extends to the soil surface 4 TerminalSpikelet The terminal spikelet initial is formed 5 FlagLeaf The appearance of flag leaf tip or ligule (??) 6 Flowering The 50% plants are flowering in the field 7 StartGrainFill Grain filling follows anthesis and refers to the period during which the kernel matures or ripens 8 EndGrainFill Grain filling follows anthesis and refers to the period during which the kernel matures or ripens 9 Maturity Grain dry weight reaches its maximum which is correlated to the absence of green color in the chaff or kernels 10 HarvestRipe Wheat is ready for harvest Each phase has a targer thermal time (earliness per se) and several impact factors to extend the growing period including vernalization, photoperiod, water, nitrogen stresses.

The phyllochron is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of leaves on the main stem of a plant. Based on (Jamieson et al. 1998), leaf appearace could be described by a base phyllochron determined between leaves 2 and 7 and a phyllochron that was 70% of base phyllochron for leaves &lt; 2 and 130% of base phyllochron for leaves &gt; 7. The base phyllochron set as 100 oCd.

The primordia number in main stem (MainStemPrimordiaNo, Section 2.2) is daily increased according to plastochron (Section 3.3) until stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2). The leaf (node in next generation APSIM) number in the main stem is daily increased according to the phyllochron (Section 3.3) until maximum leaf number is reached. The total leaf number in the main stem (MainStemFinalNodeNumber, Section 2.2) is initialized as 30 and reset as the primordia number at stage Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2). The node number in the main stem (MainStemNodeNo, Section 2.2) is daily increasing since stage Emergence (Section 3.2) until reach the final node number according to the phyllochron and daily thermal time. Figure 4.1: Final node number in main stem Daily changes of primordia (\\(\\Delta N_{pri}\\)) and node (leaf) (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) number in main stem are calculated using plastochron (\\(P_{pla}\\)) and phyllochron (\\(P_{phy}\\)), respectively, after plant stage Emergence (Section 3.2 and Figure 4.2). \\[ \\Delta N_{pri}=rac{\\Delta TT_{d}}{P_{pla}} \\] \\[ \\Delta N_{node}=rac{\\Delta TT_{t}}{P_{phy}} \\] where, \\(\\Delta TT_{t}\\) is the daily thermal time, which calculates from parameter ThermalTime. \\(P_{pla}\\) and \\(P_{phy}\\) calculates from parameter MainStemPrimordiaInitiationRate (plastochron) and MainStemNodeAppearanceRate (phyllochron), respectively (Section 3.3). The daily delta primordia number is not a output variable. Figure 4.2: Daily increase of node number in main stem Total number of primordia (\\(N_{pri}\\)) and node (\\(N_{node}\\)) in main stem are summarized since initialization. \\[ N_{pri}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{p} \\] \\[ N_{node}=\\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{n} \\] where, \\(T_{0}\\) is day of plant initialization which is set by Leaf model (Emergence for wheat). \\(T\\) is today. In the Structure model, the primordia and node numbers are not calculated for branches or tillers, but only for main stem (Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Primordia and node number in main stem The primordia and node numbers in the main stem are not necessary integar to simulate the variation of primordia number in the actual field. Consequently all attibutes of flag leaf are proportionally reduced (e.g. growth duration and maximum area). The relative appeared node number (RelativeNodeAppearance) is calculated as the fraction of appeared node number on the final node number. As the final node number is initialized as 30 as reset to primordia number at the stage Terminal Spikelet, the output variable RelativeNodeAppearance is suddenly increased at stage Terminal Spikelet (Figure 4.4). Figure 4.4: The fraction of appeared node nubmer on the final node number Wheat.Structure.RelativeNodeAppearance is not a good indicator for progress of node/leaf development, which should be avoided to use in other components. 4.2 Tillering The tiller number is too sensitive to WSC stress (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). This feature is disabled in all analysis In next generation APSIM, tillering for wheat is referred as branching. New tillers are initialized when increase of the node number in main stem (\\(\\Delta N_{node}\\)) is more than 1 although the branching rate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)) is calculate everyday (Figure 4.7). The new branch number for each plant is specified by parameter BranchingRate (\\(\\Delta N_{branch}\\)), which could be a function of branch number on leaf rank in main stem. \\[ P_{branch} = P \\times \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}\\Delta N_{branch} \\] The branching rate is defined by potential branching rate and stresses (nitrogen and WSC). From stage Emergence to Terminal Spikelet (Section 3.2), the potential branching rate is defined as a function of number of appeared cohorts in the main stem (Figure 4.5). Beyond this period, the branching rate is set as zero. Figure 4.5: Branching rate of APSIM-Wheat as a function of appreared cohort number Two stresses are defined in the APSIM-Wheat including nitrogen and WSC. A simple sensitivity analysis indicates the branching rate is too sensitive to WSC with default values (x = [0.1, 0.2]; y = [0, 1]). So, this feature is disabled for further analysis. The nitrogen stress is calculated as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand which is exported from the Arbitrator module (Chapter 9). Wheat module assumes no nitrogen stress when the nitrogen supply is bigger than 1.5 times of nitrogen demand (Figure 4.6). Nitrogen stress linearly increases when supply/demand ratio less then 1.5 (Reference required.) Figure 4.6: Nitrogen stress on branching rate as a function of fraction of nitrogen supply relative to nitrogen demand Figure 4.7 shows the branching rate and total branching number in the test simulation without nitrogen stress on branching rate during branching period (from Emergence to Terminal Spikelet, Figure 8.2). Figure 4.7: The branching rate and branch number for wheat It seems PMF uses the branching rate one day before to calculate the branch number. 4.3 Population Plant population (\\(P\\)) is initialized at sowing from Sow event, and daily reduced by the plant mortality (\\(\\Delta P\\)). \\[ P=P_{0} - \\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T}(\\Delta P) \\] where, \\(P_{0}\\) is the sown population, which initialized at sowing. Population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) is calculated according to plant population (\\(P\\)) and primary bud number (\\(N_{bud}\\)) with default value 1. The unit of \\(P_{ms}\\) is per square meter. \\[ P_{ms}=P \\times N_{bud} \\] Population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) is summed up population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) and branches ((\\(P_{branch}\\))). \\[ P_{stem} = P_{ms} + P_{branch} \\] In the test simulation, the plant density (\\(P\\)) is 150 plants m2, so population of main stem (\\(P_{ms}\\)) equals to plant density (Figure 4.8). From Emergence to terminal spikelet, the population of total stem (\\(P_{stem}\\)) multiply by stem number and plant density (Figure 4.7). Figure 4.8: The total population of main stem and all stems 4.4 Mortality Branching mortality starts from the Terminal Spikelet until Flowering which defines as a function of moving mean tiller growth rate (Figure 4.9. The mean tiller growth rate is calculated as the 5 days moving means of tiller growth rate, which is calculated by the daily biomass supply divides thermal time and total stem population. Reference required. Figure 4.9: Tiller mortality as a function of moving mean tiller growth rate Figure 4.11 and 4.10 show the mean tiller growth rate and the three factors to calculate it in the test simulation.

["cha-leaf.html", "Chapter 5 Leaf 5.1 Life growth cycle 5.2 Leaf area index 5.3 Cohort leaf area 5.4 Ground coverage 5.5 Leaf biomass 5.6 Frost impact 5.7 Drought", " Chapter 5 Leaf Leaf cohort model is used in the APSIM-Wheat. 5.1 Life growth cycle The growth cycle of leaf cohort is divided into 7 stages and 6 periods from Initialized to Detached. The length of each period depends on the plastrochron and phylochron for initialization and appearance and is configured by CohortParameters for others. Several status variables are defined for each leaf cohort, which can be used in other modules to describe the current status of leaf cohort, i.e. IsNotAppeared, IsGrowing, IsAlive, IsGreen, IsNotSenescing, Senescing, isFullyExpanded, ShouldBeDead, IsAppeared and IsInitialised. 5.1.1 leaf age The age of leaf cohort is defined as the thermal time after appearance, (i.e. keep zero after initialization). As the default values of DetachmentLagDuration and DetachmentDuration are set as 1000000 °Cd, the cohort age keeps increasing until stage ReadyForHarvesting. Figure 5.1: Age of leaf cohort as a function of stage or accumulated thermal time 5.1.2 Leaf initialization A new leaf is initialized when the primordia number is increased by 1 at the main stem. Consequently, the total leaf cohort number is equal to total primordia number. The initialized rate of leaf cohort is equal to plastochron. Figure 5.2: The primordia number in the main stem and initialised cohort number Actually, the total leaf primordia number is slightly less than the total cohort number. The plastochron supposed to 1.1 times of phyllochron. However the slope of Figure (???)(fig:leaf-init-number)B (plastochron) is constant which is contrast with the slope of (???)(fig:leaf-appear-number)B (phyllochron). 5.1.3 Leaf appearance A new leaf is appeared when the node number is increased by 1 at the main stem. Consequently, the appearance rate of leaf cohort is equal to phyllochron. Most of para,meters are determined at leaf appearance. Figure 5.3: The node number in the main stem and appeared cohort number 5.1.4 Other periods The lengths of other periods are determined when a new leaf initialized. Growth duration is defined as a phyllochron. The growth duration of spring wheat is close to one phylochron under variable light and temperature conditions (Bos and Neuteboom 1998). Figure 5.4: Growth duration of leaf cohort which is determined at appearance of leaf cohort. Lag duration is defined as 4 phyllochrons for leaf appeared during vegetative period (from emergence to terminal spikelet). For leaf cohort appeared during stem elongation period (from terminal spikelet to flag leaf), the lag duration equals to total length from stage FlagLeaf to stage EndGrainFill minus 3 phyllochron (senescence duration). Figure 5.5: Lag duration of leaf cohort which is determined at appearance of leaf cohort. Senescence duration is defined as 3 phyllochrons. Detachment lag and detachment duration are set as a big value 1000000 which assumes no detachment in wheat. Actually all leaves are detached at Harvesting event. Figure 5.6 shows the number of leaf cohort for expanding, initialized, appeared, senescing and dead cohort. Figure 5.6: Initialized, appeared and expanding cohort number The cohort population is reudced by plant and stem mortality… The total leaf number is multiplied by leaf cohort number and stem number (Figure 5.7). Figure 5.7: Appeared number of green, senesced and total leaves The fraction of final leaf is set as 1, but return the actual fraction of the final leaf if the last leaf has appeared. Figure 5.8: Fraction of final leaf Not sure about the main point of final leaf fraction. The fraction is not integer as the final node number is not an integer. 5.2 Leaf area index Leaf area index (LAI) are calculated for green leaf (\\(\\text{LAI}_{g}\\)), dead leaf (\\(\\text{LAI}_{d}\\)), and total leaf (\\(\\text{LAI}_{t}\\)). Leaf area is the minium value between carbon limitation and water limation… 5.2.1 Leaf size The logistic function is used to simulate leaf size… 5.2.2 Maximum leaf area The maximum leaf area of each leaf cohort is determined by potential maximum leaf area and reduced by cell division stress and final leaf fraction when leaf cohort is appeared. The potential maximum leaf areas by rank are specified by two parameters the maximum leaf area in all leaves (AreaLargestLeaves with default value 2600 mm2) and an age factor (Figure 5.9). The age factor is assumed leaf areas are linearly increasing from stage Emergence to Terminal spikelet, and all leaves appeared after stage Terminal Spikelet have the same maximum leaf area (the last three leaves in the current configuration of plastochron and phyllochron, Figure 4.3). Figure 5.9: Multiplier of maximum leaf area as a function of growthing stage In the previous version of APSIM-Wheat model, the x-value of leaf area profile is RelativeNodeAppearance. However RelativeNodeAppearance is suddenly increased at stage Terminal Spikelet which is caused by resetting of final node number. The stress factor of cell division is determined by water (Figure 7.1) and nitrogen stresses (Figure 8.1). Stress of cell division is accumulated from initialization to appearance (average in actual …) In the test simulation, the maximum leaf areas are increasing from Rank 1 to Rank 9, then decreasing to flag leaf (Figure 5.10), which is caused by nitrogen stress after terminal spikelet (Figure 8.1). Figure 5.10: Maximum area of leaf cohort as a function of stage or accumulated thermal time 5.3 Cohort leaf area Figure 5.11: Delta of leaf area constrained by water and carbon. Figure 5.12: Leaf area by leaf cohort Not sure about the meaning of leaf size? Figure 5.13: Leaf size by leaf cohort Figure 5.14: Leaf area index 5.4 Ground coverage and coverage are calculated for green leaf (\\(C_g\\)), dead leaf (\\(C_d\\)), and total leaf (\\(C_t\\)) from LAI and extinction coefficient for green leaf (\\(k_{g}\\)) and dead leaf (\\(k_{d}\\)). \\[ C_{g}=C_{max}(1-\\exp(-k_{g}\\frac{\\text{LAI}_{g}}{C_{max}})) \\] As the default value of maximum coverage (\\(C_{max}\\)) is 1, the function is reduced to \\[ C_{g}=1-\\exp(-k_{g}\\text{LAI}_{g}) \\] The similar equation is used for dead coverage. \\[ C_{d}=1-\\exp(-k_{d}\\text{LAI}_{d}) \\] Total coverage (\\(C_t\\)) is calculated from coverage of green and dead leaves. \\[ C_{t} = 1 - (1 - C_{g})(1 - C_{d}) \\] The extinction coefficient for dead leaf (\\(k_{d}\\)) is defined as 0.3. The extinction coefficient for green leaf (\\(k_{g}\\)) is calculated by parameter ExtinctionCoeff which is depending on LAI and water stress. In the current version of APSIM-Wheat, extinction coefficient is set as 0.5 without variation as leaf area index. Extinction coefficient of dead leaf (kd) is not setable in the APSIM User Interface which is defined in the xml file. Figure 5.15: Extinction coefficient as a function of leaf area index (LAI) The extinction coefficient of green leaf is adjusted by water stress which is the ratio of water supply and demand. No adjustment is applied to extinction coefficient if water supply is more than water demand. However, extinction coefficient is reduced when water supply is less than water demand (Figure 5.16, i.e. \\(k\\) = 0.25 when no water supply).
