# Overview {#cha:overview}

The APSIM-Wheat model is based on a framework of the physiological determinants of crop growth and development [@charles-edwards_physiological_1982;@hammer_sorghum_2016] and is focused at organ scale. 

## Organs

In the wheat module, wheat is divided into four components or parts: Root, Heat, Leaf and Stem. Leaf includes only leaf blades. Stem is defined in a functional rather than amorphological manner and includes plant stems, leaf sheaths. Head is divided into Grain and Pod (which correspond to spike without the grain).
