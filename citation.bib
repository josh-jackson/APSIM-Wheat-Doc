  abstract = {In recent literature on Gramineae species, leaf and tiller number dynamics have been studied by analysing site filling and the phyllochron of the mainstem. However, site filling is influenced by three components: (1) the phyllochron of the mainstem and daughter tillers; (2) specific site usage (i.e. fraction of buds that ultimately develop into a visible tiller at a specific site); and (3) HS-delay (i.e. difference in Haun Stage (HS) between the parent tiller and daughter tiller above the point where the daughter tiller appears). These three morphological components affecting site filling were studied under different environmental conditions in a growth chamber experiment with spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivumL.). Treatments were temperature (daily average 10.5, 15.5 or 20.5 \{degrees\}C) and light intensity (111, 191 or 286 \{micro\}mol m-2s-1). Effects of temperature and light intensity on phyllochron were well described by equations already reported in the literature. Specific site usage was higher at cooler temperatures and greater light intensities and was related to tiller position. It is proposed that these effects on specific site usage reflect differences in availability of local assimilate for tiller appearance. HS-delay of a tiller was shorter if the expected tiller appearance was later and was only slightly affected by light intensity or temperature. This new concept, combining HS-delay and specific site usage, can be useful in constructing more general models of the effects of environmental factors on the dynamics of leaf number and leaf area ofGramineaespecies.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

  abstract = {Sirius is a wheat simulation model that calculates biomass production from intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and grain growth from simple partitioning rules. Leaf area index (LAI) is developed from a thermal time sub-model. Phenological development is calculated from the mainstem leaf appearance rate and final leaf number, with the latter determined by responses to daylength and vernalisation. Effects of water and N deficits are calculated through their influences on LAI development and radiation-use efficiency. This paper describes the model and its validation using data from independent and near independent experiments at Lincoln, New Zealand, and Rothamsted, UK. Despite there being no calculation of tiller dynamics or grain number, the model accurately simulated the behaviour of crops exposed to a wide range of conditions. We conclude that the accurate prediction of phenological development and LAI is much more important for grain yield prediction than are the components of yield. Although grain population is not a necessary step in yield calculation in Sirius, the model proved useful in investigating the effects of stress in setting grain number. The analysis showed that the influence of stress on partitioning of biomass to the ear during pre-anthesis ear growth was much more important in determining grain number than was the effect on biomass accumulation during the same phase.},

  abstract = {Existing models of leaf area expansion of Gramineae species based on individual leaf growth are descriptive and assume that there is no effect of tiller type on individual leaf area. However, sound experimental data on the growth of individual leaves on a plant are lacking. A growth chamber experiment was carried out with young spring wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) plants, and individual leaf area parameters were measured. Treatments were temperature (daily mean 10.5, 15.5 and 20.5 \{degrees\}C) and light intensity (111, 191 and 286 \{micro\}mol m-2s-1). Effects of leaf position and tiller type on maximum leaf width and leaf elongation rate (LER) could be explained by a new assumption, that maximum leaf width, and LER, of a leaf depend on the values for the previous foliar leaf on the same tiller, or on the parent tiller. LER increased linearly with temperature and was not affected by light intensity, whereas maximum leaf width was not influenced by temperature or light intensity. Leaf elongation duration was closely related to phyllochron expressed in days, although this relation was slightly modified by light intensity. Equations formulated for each leaf area parameter accounted for 90\% of the variation in leaf area between different leaf types, temperatures and light intensities. The results give a better general understanding of individual leaf growth of Gramineae species and can be used in the development of more mechanistic models for the simulation of leaf area expansion.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},
